# Guessing Game 

---

## Description:
The Guessing Game is a simple application where a user is tasked with guessing a randomly selected number within a specified time limit. The game provides feedback to the user based on their guesses, guiding them to guess higher or lower as necessary. If the user guesses the correct number within the time limit, they win; otherwise, they lose.

## Features:
- Random number selection within a user-defined range.
- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) with varying time limits.
- User input for selecting difficulty and range.
- Countdown timer displayed on the interface.
- Feedback messages for guiding the user's guesses.
- Message boxes for notifying the user of win or loss.

## How to Play:
1. Run the application.
2. On Form 1, select the desired difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and specify the range for the random number.
3. Click on the "Start Game" button.
4. On Form 2, input your guesses within the given time limit.
5. Receive feedback messages based on your guesses.
6. If you guess the correct number within the time limit, you win; otherwise, you lose.

## Development Notes:
- The application consists of two forms: Form 1 for selecting difficulty and range, and Form 2 for playing the game.
- Communication between Form 1 and Form 2 is facilitated through a static method.
- Range validation and user input validation are not implemented. The application focuses on functionality rather than extensive validation.
- The countdown timer is implemented as a label that displays the remaining time.

## Additional Information:
- Difficulty levels and their corresponding time limits:
  - Easy: 70 seconds
  - Medium: 60 seconds
  - Hard: 40 seconds
- Developers can customize additional difficulty levels or adjust existing ones as needed.
